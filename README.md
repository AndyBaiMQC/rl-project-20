COMP 767 - Reinforcement Learning Final Project

# Algorithms Implemented:

On-policy: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Off-policy: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Twin delayed DDPG (TD3)

# Run Instructions

1. PPO

To run, simply open Car_Racing_ppo.ipynb on Colab. Please make sure you select GPU accelerator enabled on Colab for best training experiences.

2. TD3/DDPG
